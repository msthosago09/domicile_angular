  <h2>Putting people and planet first</h2>
  Concern for the safety of people and the sustainability of our environment. That is what drives Domicile as a
  full-service, integrated consulting firm specialising in occupational health, safety and environment (OHSE) in the
  construction, mining and manufacturing sectors.

  We are a 100% black female-owned company that comprises a committed team of young professionals. We pride ourselves on
  our astute work ethic, on the exceptional quality of our work and on our sound client relationships.

  Our client-centric approach involves more than simply respecting and valuing our clients’ time and resources; we aim
  to truly understand their aspirations in undertaking the projects they do, so we may share those goals in bringing
  their vision to life.

  These qualities have nurtured our solid reputation in the industry for consistently providing cost-efficient OHSE
  solutions, as well as delivering completed projects that are on time, within scope and on budget.


  <h2>Specialised skills</h2>
  All the employees within our team are provided with basic training to ensure a solid foundation from which to grow
  their areas of specialty and perform their key responsibilities.

  Over and above these employees have extensive experience in their respective fields within the construction, mining
  and manufacturing industries.

  Our OHS agents are registered with the South African Council for the Projects and Construction Management Professions
  (SACPCMP), and our safety officer and representatives are registered with South African Institute of Occupational
  Safety and Health (SAIOSH).

  years’ industry experience.
